      "Welcome to Day 1 of 30-Day Abs With Abel Albonetti! As you already know if you read the overview of the program on the main page (you did that, right?), each of these workouts pairs with your normal weekly split. So today's workout is designed to use your chest as a secondary muscle group, while you work your abs.",
      "This ab workout consists of three exercises, each performed for 4 straight sets of 12 reps. This is pure strength and muscle-building work, the kind that will pay off in building the bricks of your six-pack and making your abs really pop.",
      "If a few sets of 12 doesn't sound like a lot, then be prepared for a new challenge. Each exercise is plenty tough on its own, but all three together should surprise you. Be prepared to push the upper end of the rest period range.",
      "Here are the essential cues for your moves today:",
      "Weighted sit-up: Choose a weight you can manageably hold a few inches off of your chest with your arms. Holding the weight creates a greater challenge for your core, while simultaneously working your chest, shoulders, and arms.",
      "Suspended crunch: If your gym doesn't have a suspension strap system or TRX, you can perform the suspended crunch on a swiss ball instead. Place your feet on the ball, crunching your knees to your chest with each rep, and returning to the straight plank position without letting your hips or lower back sag.",
      "Hanging exercise ball leg raise: Leg raise variations are difficult for even experienced lifters, so if you haven't yet mastered them, try doing these leg raises on the floor or on a decline bench. Hold the ball in the same way, and as you lift your legs, contract your core and lift your hips to really work the abs."

You can also perform this exercise on the ground with a dumbbell balanced on its side on your top hip to create added resistance.",

You'll start with your hands on the floor and your feet on the bench for slow mountain climbers, really focusing on the rotation of the hips as you bring your knee across your body. Then, you'll flip around for bench oblique crunches, rotating your legs to one side and crunching through the obliques again as you lift your feet up.

Start with the roller higher on your shins at first, then move it toward your ankles as your strength and skill improves.

      "Toes-to-bar: This upgrade on the hanging leg raise requires a lot of flexibility to perform perfectly, so don't stress if you're having trouble keeping your legs perfectly straight as you lift them up to the bar. Your main focus on this exercise is tucking your hips to engage the abs and using your muscles instead of momentum to lift. If you find you have to swing a little bit to get your legs to the bar, just make sure you do a slow negative as you lower them back down. That way you can still build core strength. If you can't do 12 reps, well, do as many as you can. If you can only perform 5 or fewer reps, perform hanging leg raises instead.",

      "Gorilla chin-up crunch: Grip the pull-up bar using a neutral or supine grip, both of which are stronger than the standard prone grip used for pull-ups. Lift your chin over the bar, then pull your knees up to your chest in a crunch. Hold for a beat, then lower your legs, then your body, back down to the starting position. That's one rep. If you can't perform chin-ups right now, just perform the movement with your arms held in a bent position. If you're not quite strong enough to perform the movement hanging, you can also modify the exercise using arm slings.",
